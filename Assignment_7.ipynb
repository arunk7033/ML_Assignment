    "#Solution:\n",
    "In machine learning, the target function, also known as the target or objective function, is the function that a predictive\n",
    "model aims to approximate or learn. The target function represents the relationship between input features and the desired\n",
    "output, which the model tries to capture during the training process.\n",
    "* Definition of Target Function:\n",
    "The target function is the ideal mapping from input features to output values that we want the machine learning model to learn.\n",
    "* Real-Life Example:\n",
    "Suppose we are building a house price prediction model. The target function, in this case, would map features such as the \n",
    "number of bedrooms, square footage, location, etc., to the corresponding house price.\n",
    "* Assessing a Target Function's Fitness:\n",
    "The fitness or accuracy of a target function is typically assessed by comparing its predictions to the actual outcomes in a\n",
    "dataset. Common metrics include:\n",
    "1. Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual values.\n",
    "2. Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Measures the average absolute difference between predicted and actual values.\n",
    "3. R-squared (R²): Represents the proportion of variance in the target variable explained by the model.\n",
    "* Example Assessment:\n",
    "In the house price prediction example, if the model predicts house prices that are close to the actual prices based on the \n",
    "chosen metrics, it indicates a higher fitness of the target function.The goal in machine learning is to iteratively adjust the\n",
    "model's parameters during training to minimize the difference between the predictions of the target function and the actual\n",
    "outcomes in the training data. As a result, the model becomes better at approximating the underlying target function, leading \n",
    "to improved performance on new, unseen data."
